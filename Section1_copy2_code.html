  <h1>Things to Know about the Web - Section 1</h1>
      <div class="section">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>The Web</h2>
        </div>
              <p>
                The web is is made of many different components, first of which  is us, the user.  We type in commands  on our computer which get sent over the internet from our web browsers to servers using <em>HTTP</em>.  The servers interperet the commands and respond accordingly.
              </p>
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>HTML</h2>
        </div>          
              <p>
                HTML is the basis for everything on the web and stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language.</em> HTML constist of:
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Text Content</em> - Everything you see<br>
                <em>Markup</em> - What it looks like<br>
                <em>References</em> - to other documents like images and videos<br>
                <em>Links to other pages</em> - Links are referred to as URLs.  Clicking on links, moving deeper into web content is why its called the <em><b>Web</b>.</em>  
              </p>
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>HTML Markup</h2>
        </div>
              <p>
                <em>HTML Markup</em> is what the content looks like.  Markup consist of <em>Tags</em> and <em>Attributes</em> <br>
                defined within an <em>Element.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                An Element contains of an opening tag, a closing tag, and content inbetween the two tags.<br>
                If a tag has only an opening tag, but no closing tag, it is called a <em>Void Tag.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                Attributes are also part of an element, so also contained inside a tag.  Attributes will point to a value.
                  </p>
       <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>Inline vs Block</h2>
       </div>
              <p>
                <em>Inline Elements</em> will exist on one line and next line without spacing, like this example:<br>
                This is an inline element<br>
                This is also an inline element
              </p>

              <p>
                <em>Block Elements</em> have a defined space around them that can be made larger or smaller.  Here is an example:<br>
              </p>

              <p>
                This is a block element 
              </p>
               <p>
                 This is also a block element
               </p>  
     </div>
<h1>More Things to Know about the Web - Section 2</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2>Structure of a Web Page</h2>
      </div>
          <p>
            <b>HTML</b> - The overall structure of a web page, much like the walls of a room<br>
            <b>CSS</b> - How the page is styled - much like the decoration on the wall or the color it is painted.<br>
            <b>Javascript</b> - Changing an element of a web page, much like flipping a light switch or using a remote control.
          </p>
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2>Web Browser and Development Tools</h2>
      </div>
          <p>
            The web browser builds a tree-like structure of the web page.  This is referred to as the <b>DOM</b> or <b>Document Object Model</b>.<br>
            The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a <em>Tree</em>.  
          </p> 
          <p>
            HTML elements in the structure have an opening tag and a closing tag.
            The information contained between the tags can be <em>Text, Span, Div, Img, Src</em>, etc.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each browser has its own set of <em>Development Tools</em> which shows the structure and style of the web page.<br></p>
          <p>
            Elements displayed in the development tools are not the actual code, but the structure of the web page as the browser interprets it.
          </p>
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2>Languages</h2>
      </div>
            <p>
              HTML and CSS are both <em>"languages"</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>HTML Language</b> controls the structure of the page and applies specific syntax and rules to the page.  The basic word of the HTML Language is a "tag".
              Tags make up elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>CSS Language</b> controls the style of the page.  CSS uses specific syntax and rules to determine how the HTML elements will appear on the page.
            </p>
      </div>
      
<h1>Adding CSS Style - Section 3</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2> CSS Gives Us Stlye!</h2>
      </div>
          <p>
          CSS or <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>, define how <em>HTML</em> elements are to be displayed in the browser.  CSS attributes can be applied directly into the HTML or from an outside <em><b>.css</b></em> file.  Using a <em>.css</em> file is the preferred way by developers so the HTML and CSS files can be separate and easier to work with.  
          </p>
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2> CSS Saves Us a Lot of Work!</h2>
      </div>
          <p> The main function of using CSS is the ability to change the style of HTML documents in one place.  By assigning classes to HTML elements, one can simply change the style of an entire class with one change to the <em>.css</em> class file.  The main two reasons this is important is that it:<br>
            1. <b>Avoids Repetition</b> - The developer does not need to style individual elements or lines of code taking more time.<br>
            2. <b>Avoids Mistakes</b> - By making one change instead of several changes, the developer can avoid the potential for costly errors.
          </p>
